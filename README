I've started doing some Project Euler problems when I have a chance, mainly to improve my Haskell. I'm hosting them here for my own convenience. All the code is unlicensed and without warranty, use as you wish. I wouldn't take these solutions as reference, they are just the way I decided to solve them. If you want to discuss the solutions with me, feel free to message me, but there are plenty of forums dedicated to people solving these problems.

Build all examples using ghc --make solution.hs and run with ./solution
I used ghc 6.12 throughout, but these solutions should be compatible with most Haskell 98 compilers. 

Thanks to http://projecteuler.net/ for putting up some interesting problems :)
